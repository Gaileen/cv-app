# React + Vite

This is the CV Application project from The Odin Project's React course.

Due to tiem constraints, main functionality (using state to maintain user input across components) has been prioritized.

Things that need to be worked on in the future:
- Page Styling,
- Display the rest of the user's input in the Resume display,
- and Print PDF button.
